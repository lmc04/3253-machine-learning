# 3253-machine-learning
My contribution to the final project of the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies course 3253 - Machine Learning. We selected the Cargo Theft FBI dataset and applied data processing and machine learning to try to predict if a stolen cargo could be recovered or not and to predict the recovered value.

The presentation for this project can be viewed at [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-85uTA-h-s).
